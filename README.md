# OctoPrint Plastic Pilot
A plugin to control the 3D printer with a USB controller

why? because it's fun! 

--

## Current status:
The movement is pretty janky 

I've only tested an Xbox-One (USB-C -> USB-A) controller over USB

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

## TODO:
- Button mapping
- 
- Confirm support for different controllers
  - maybe custom profiles for popular controllers
- Twitch integration (hahahahahaha)
- Bluetooth controller support
- Xbox Kinect support (is this even possible?)
- Wii remote support
- Flight stick support
